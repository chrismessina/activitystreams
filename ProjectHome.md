ActivityStreams is an effort to create a format for expressing actors, verbs and objects in Atom feeds.

# Specifications #
The latest draft specifications are:
  * [Atom Activity Extensions](http://martin.atkins.me.uk/specs/activitystreams/atomactivity) (Feb 28, 2009)
  * [Atom Activity Base Schema](http://martin.atkins.me.uk/specs/activitystreams/activityschema) (Feb 28, 09)

The official Git repository containing their XML source is maintained by Martin Atkins at http://github.com/apparentlymart/activity-streams-specs/tree/master.  We use the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/activitystreams/issues/list) within Google Code to keep track of stuff still to do.

# Mailing List #
The community uses the [Activity Streams group](http://groups.google.com/group/activity-streams) to discuss the specifications and reach consensus on proposed changes.

# Wiki #
The wiki is at http://activitystreams.pbwiki.com/, though it's not really used much yet.
